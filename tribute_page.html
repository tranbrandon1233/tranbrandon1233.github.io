            <h1>About Albert Einstein</h1>
            <p>Albert Einstein is one of, if not the most, renowned physicist of all time and made great strides in helping us understand the universe.
            Einstein was a German physicist who formulated the theory of relativity. His brilliant explanation of the photoelectric effect earned him a Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.
            As a result of his work, Einstein became one of the most distinguished scientists of the century.
            In addition to his scientific endeavors, Einstein was also a pacifist. His Jewish ancestry forced him to immigrate from Germany 
            to the United States in December 1932 as the Nazis gained power in his home country.</p>

               <p>Einstein's most well-known discoveries were the theory of relativity and the famous equation E = mc^2, 
                  which earned him fame across the world and radically altered our knowledge of the universe.</p>

               <h1>Impact</h1>
               <p>Today, Einstein is revered for his research on physics and has had a remarkable impact on modern society. His work provided
                  a far greater explanation of gravity and helped create the first atomic bomb.
